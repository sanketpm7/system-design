Zookeeper:
WebSocket Manager provides a way for the server to push data to the client in real-time and enables bidirectional communication between the two endpoints and is typically used in web applications that require real-time updates or messaging. On the other hand, ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service that provides a centralized repository for storing configuration information and synchronization data across a distributed system. I will prefer Websocket manager terminology.
